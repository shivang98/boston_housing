## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview
In this project, I will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. I will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics.


## Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and I want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with my peers, I decide to leverage a few basic machine learning concepts to assist me and a client with finding the best selling price for their home. Luckily, I\'ve come across the Boston Housing dataset which contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. My task is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for my clients\' homes.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

you will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.
